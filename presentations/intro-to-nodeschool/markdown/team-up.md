## Before you start&hellip;

Pick any workshopper you&rsquo;re interested in. We encourage you to collaborate with others, but you don&rsquo;t have to. If you want to team up, ask one of the mentors to help you out.<!-- .element: class="fragment"  -->

Note:
- You can perfectly do a workshopper on your own, but you can optionally team up with someone else. We actually recommend it, as it's more fun and you'll learn a lot more. Don't feel like it? That's cool too!
